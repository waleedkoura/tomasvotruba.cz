                        Recently I gave <a href="/talks/#monorepo">a few talks about monorepo in PHP</a> and how to integrate it to companies in a useful way. I'm very happy to see many people already use it and know what problems it solves.
<br><br>
Before monorepo hype takes over private PHP projects, I think <strong>you should know about its limits</strong>: When is the best time for you to <a href="https://gomonorepo.org/">go monorepo</a>? When you gain less complexity while integrating it? How can you make the transition better? Is it really needed?
                    </div>
                </div>

                
                <p>There are already <a href="/clusters/#monorepo-from-zero-to-hero">6 posts</a> about why is monorepo so good in dealing with complexity. So if you hear about it the first time or still don't believe it might help you, go check those.</p>
<p>Today we'll not focus on open-source projects, but <strong>rather on your private code</strong>. All from point of <strong>timing and transition</strong>. Let me show you the architecture that <a href="https://www.lekarna.cz/">Lekarna.cz</a> uses to this day and how did we get there despite very chaotic start.</p>
<h3 id="1-monolith"><a href="#1-monolith">1. Monolith</a></h3>
<p>We started development in a single repository, adding features here and there. It grew, the <code>/src</code> directory had over 150 classes very soon and it became more and more cluttered. The development was coupled to one monolithic code and the architecture started to disappear from code-review focus and from the code itself. <strong>Not good.</strong></p>
<p>↓</p>
<h3 id="2-many-repository"><a href="#2-many-repository">2. Many-Repository</a></h3>
<p>So we've decided to split too many repositories. There was a repository <code>lekarna/cms</code>, <code>lekarna/shop</code>, <code>lekarna/warehouse</code> etc.</p>
<p>First, it looked cool, each with own repository, own <code>composer.json</code>. Now you can spot this <em>academic coolness</em> by <strong>focusing mostly on technical facts</strong> (e.g. each repository has own <code>composer.json</code>) rather <strong>than how it feels to use it</strong> (e.g. it really sucks to do one change in many places).</p>
<p>In every PR more energy and attention was invested in the maintenance of there many-repositories and their mutual dependencies, than to PR itself. <strong>Not good.</strong></p>
<p>↓</p>
<h3 id="3-local-packages"><a href="#3-local-packages">3. Local Packages</a></h3>
<p>We realized, we needed the code to be at one place <strong>and</strong> keep it as separate as possible. In 2014 it didn't have a name, but I came with an idea to create a <code>/packages</code> directory in our main repository and <em>pretend</em> we have repositories there. <em>Treat it like</em> one day it might be decoupled to own repository, with own dependencies and own tests. Few years later it became known as <a href="/blog/2017/12/25/composer-local-packages-for-dummies/">local packages</a>.</p>
<p>This lead new programmers to focus deeply on a single part of huge codebase at a time and also make changes the easiest way possible. <strong>We didn't have to explain them anything</strong>, the knowledge was embodied in the code. This is a <strong>golden pattern you look for</strong> in any part of business or life - you just give people smartphone and they <em>intuitively know</em> what to do.</p>
<p>↓</p>
<h3 id="4-open-sourced-monorepo"><a href="#4-open-sourced-monorepo">4. Open-Sourced Monorepo</a></h3>
<p>This next step can be used to build a community to fuel your code-base. It's a state when your <strong>need a feedback from the community to push the quality further</strong> and also turning that code to a product for others. That's what happened to all companies that were private in the start - Symfony, Sylius or Shopsys.</p>
<p>But this was not a step for Lekarna.cz code-base. It has no such ambitions and it doesn't make sense. You don't have to do everything you can, just because you can.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>So do <em>local packages</em> have meaning? <strong>Yes, they do</strong>, because their purpose is not to become an open-source monorepo company, but to make your private/public code as easy to work with as possible while it grows. In short: <strong>to enjoy coding in very large code-bases.</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="when-you-should-evolve"><a href="#when-you-should-evolve">When You Should Evolve?</a></h2>
<p>As you can see, we had to make many costly transitions. Switching from monolith to many-repo and then to local packages is no cheap fun.</p>
<p>The rule that guides a <strong>good transition</strong> is:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    Value after transition &gt; Cost lost by transition
</blockquote>
<p>E.g. if your project is 20 % easier to contribute, but it costs 50 % of your team energy on learning new technologies, fixing regression bugs or not believing in it, it's not worth it.</p>
<p>As future is unclear and hindsight is always 20/20, these numbers are not easy to establish before you do any real change. <strong>So how to decide?</strong> You can see the code <strong>is maturing and is ready to evolution jump</strong>. If we take a broader picture and look at PHP frameworks, in the last 5 years there is a big evolution jump from service locators to constructor injection. Do you want a more recent example? Weak typing to strict typing.</p>
<p>You just feel it. It's not an easy skill to build but <strong>the more and more you develop and make transitions, the more you'll improve this skill and your success rate</strong>. You'll get there by trying, believe in yourself and learn from mistakes. How crazy this might sound, the more mistakes you make, the faster you learn.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="when-monorepo-makes-sense-for-private-projects"><a href="#when-monorepo-makes-sense-for-private-projects">When Monorepo Makes sense For Private Projects?</a></h2>
<p>I was asked this question at <a href="https://www.hubbr.cz/udalosti/events/developer-day-2018">Developer Day 2018</a> (amazing event by amazing brothers duo). To answer completely: if I were you, I'd <strong>start every project with local packages by default</strong>. You never ever have to jump to monorepo nor open-source, but you make any future possible transition very cheap. Very!</p>
<p>All it costs you is to learn what local packages are how to work with them. Too busy to learn? Just <a href="/contact/">give me a call</a> and I'll explain it to you.</p>
<p>Because one day, you might see one of obvious <strong>reasons to go monorepo</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your product becomes useful to others</li>
<li>Your component becomes useful to others</li>
<li>You develop <strong>multiple-projects with the same code base</strong>, e.g. 5 projects running on Symfony 4.1</li>
<li>You develop the <strong>single project for multiple clients</strong>, e.g. one e-commerce platform for 10 customers</li>
</ol>
<p>And we're still in privates here.</p>
<p>But these <strong>reasons never have to come</strong>, so just going monorepo blindly from the start might actually hurt your development.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Happy evolving!</p>
