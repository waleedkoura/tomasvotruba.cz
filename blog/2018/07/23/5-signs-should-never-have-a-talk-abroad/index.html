                        I find PHP meetups abroad more and more valuable to my programming life. They're the best place to diverse my skills and knowledge without eating dump and self-proclaiming Twitter feeds.
<br>
<br>
Wait, don't rush to your train ticket so fast to enjoy the presence of great developers, interesting topic, surprisingly open-minded people and tasty beer afterward.
<br>
<br>
I'm about to tell you why you should not do it.
                    </div>
                </div>

                
                <h2 id="1-you-re-not-famous-enough-to-be-accepted"><a href="#1-you-re-not-famous-enough-to-be-accepted">1. You're not Famous Enough to be Accepted</a></h2>
<p><em class="fas fa-fw fa-times text-danger fa-2x"></em></p>
<p>I'm sorry, but you were not born lucky enough to be Linus Torvalds, Rasmus Lerdorf, Fabien Potencier or Marco Pivetta. You'd have to work hard on yourself, have at least 1000 followers, 3 popular open-source packages and own website with real PHP blog posts.</p>
<p>From my experience, if you response to Call for Papers to one of <a href="http://php.net/conferences/index.php">the PHP conferences</a> there are free 10 times fewer talk slots than talk suggestions.</p>
<div class="text-center mb-4">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/friends/ou.png" class="img-thumbnail"><br><img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/friends/ou2.png" class="img-thumbnail"><br><em>Selection of my rejections</em>
</div>
<p>Only a madman would not give up this, right?</p>
<p><em class="fas fa-fw fa-check text-success fa-2x"></em></p>
<p>How wrong was I thinking this? Meetups and conferences are a completely different field. Meetups are held almost every month and I can tell you, every organizer is super happy for an active speaker who writes him with a talk proposal. And an active speaker from abroad? <strong>Shut-up up and take my money!</strong></p>
<p>What do you need to do? Go to a meetup.com event detail, ask in comments to have a talk with this title, 2-3 sentences what it's about and length in minutes. It usually didn't take longer than 2 days before I got <em>you're accepted</em> email.</p>
<p>Some groups make this experience even more exceptional, like:</p>
<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/friends/berlin.png" class="img-thumbnail"><br><em><a href="http://www.bephpug.de/">Berlin PHP User Group</a> is fully open-sourced on Github, so all you need to do send PR</em>

    <br><img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/friends/vienna.png" class="img-thumbnail"><br><em><a href="https://www.meetup.com/viennaphp/">Vienna PHP</a> provides simple form, also on homepage → click &amp; send it
</em></div>
<h2 id="2-you-re-too-shy-to-talk"><a href="#2-you-re-too-shy-to-talk">2. You're too Shy to Talk</a></h2>
<p><em class="fas fa-fw fa-times text-danger fa-2x"></em></p>
<p>People living abroad are much more skilled, have high standards and are very critique. Just imagine you'd confuse <code>sort</code> with <code>asort</code> - you're dead.</p>
<p><em class="fas fa-fw fa-check text-success fa-2x"></em></p>
<p>I'm not sure if that's <em>the Czech Republic</em> or <em>home-country</em> effect, but I find programmers in other countries more curious, with questions, own ideas, and own experiments. Instead of saying how your idea is bad or why they propose situations when it could go wrong and want to hear arguments from you. Also, they're not so focused on nitpicking, but rather they try to understand the main idea of your talk.</p>
<p>And as for mistakes? I think going abroad is the best to battle-test anything. When people go on holidays, they're naturally more open to people, because they know they'll never see them again (unless you go 10 years to the same destination over and over again).</p>
<p>Are you shy? Don't have a talk in your hometown where everyone knows you, but go somewhere new where nobody knows you.</p>
<h2 id="3-you-re-not-very-good-at-english-tongue"><a href="#3-you-re-not-very-good-at-english-tongue">3. You're not very Good at English Tongue</a></h2>
<p><em class="fas fa-fw fa-times text-danger fa-2x"></em></p>
<p>Abroad, there are only native English speakers and they will always correct your mistakes, typos and non-precise wording. Why do you think English programmers go to meetup anyway?</p>
<p><em class="fas fa-fw fa-check text-success fa-2x"></em></p>
<p>This could not be far from the truth. In my experience, I've been meeting roughly 10 % of native English speakers. Instead, they're from Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Hungary, Slovakia, Netherlands, Belgium or Poland. Imagine having all these nationalities together, in one room, almost all of them having English as seconds language (in the best case scenario).</p>
<p>In such a group being too good in English would actually hurt you. The most common vocabulary that everyone understands the most wins.
After all, <a href="https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/">1000 words</a> are all you need.</p>
<h2 id="4-you-don-t-have-money-for-traveling-and-airbnb"><a href="#4-you-don-t-have-money-for-traveling-and-airbnb">4. You don't have Money for Traveling and AirBnb</a></h2>
<p><em class="fas fa-fw fa-times text-danger fa-2x"></em></p>
<p>Let's admit it, traveling abroad is not cheap. A return ticket from Prague to Berlin can cost over 50 €! And the AirBnb once more the same amount. And who of our programmers with poor pays can afford that?</p>
<p>If there only would be organizer you ask for accommodation or one of the other speakers or a friend. But that would be pure hope, no chance.</p>
<p><em class="fas fa-fw fa-check text-success fa-2x"></em></p>
<p>All you need to do is check <a href="https://www.meetup.com/sfugberlin/events/">the meetup</a> and write to the organizer and the speakers. Why? Because these people are usually the most opened one. Thanks, <a href="http://mhlavac.net/">Martin Hlaváč</a> for an awesome stay that helped me for this tip.</p>
<h2 id="5-it-s-very-hard-to-find-these-meetups"><a href="#5-it-s-very-hard-to-find-these-meetups">5. It's Very Hard to Find these Meetups</a></h2>
<p><em class="fas fa-fw fa-times text-danger fa-2x"></em></p>
<p>You can go to meetup.com and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/find/events/?allMeetups=false&amp;keywords=php">search for PHP</a>. But meetup.com is designed for all meetups, not just PHP, so there are many boiler place features you don't need and nice map around your location is missing. Despite that, not all groups are there, they' use GitHub Page, Facebook, Twitter or own calendar.</p>
<div class="text-center mb-4">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/friends/meetupcom.png" class="img-thumbnail"><br><em>Search on meetup.com is not really friendly</em>
</div>
<p>The second option is to go to <a href="http://php.ug/">php.ug</a> and try to find meetups around you. This project is much better than meetup.com because it's <a href="https://github.com/php-ug/php.ug">open-sourced</a> and community can fix it, but it's not very active for the last 2 years.</p>
<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/friends/phpug.png" class="img-thumbnail"><br><em>Current Meetup coverage at php.ug</em>
</div>
<p><em class="fas fa-fw fa-check text-success fa-2x"></em></p>
<p>Make no mistake, <a href="https://github.com/heiglandreas">Andreas Heigl</a> is doing a great job with <a href="http://php.ug/">php.ug</a>, with Slack promotion and so on. I talked with him about this project, because I really missed a place where people could see meetups around them that would just work. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you, Andreas, for inspiration, working API on php.ug and super fast bugfixes under 60 minutes from reporting</strong>. Be sure to check <a href="http://andreas.heigl.org/">his blog</a> - I love his kind and wise style of sharing his experience.</p>
