                        Last month you could not call me, cause I was on a month trip to Asia. For fun? Of course, <strike>but also</strike> for <a href="https://2018.phpconf.asia/">PHP Conference Asia</a> where I talked about <a href="https://github.com/rectorphp/rector">Rector</a>. <br><br> It was my first trip to Asia ever, so obviously, it went wrong...
                    </div>
                </div>

                
                <h2 id="complex-over-simple"><a href="#complex-over-simple">Complex over Simple</a></h2>
<p>I was flying to <a href="https://2018.phpconf.asia">PHP Conf Asia</a> that was held in Singapore from the beautiful city of Berlin... in 1 flight? No, that would too easy for me. Sometimes I want to go to my past me, <strong>slap him and make him choose the easy way for once</strong>.</p>
<p>So I picked rather <strong>dynamic trip</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>from Berlin to Riga - 1,5 hours flight</li>
<li>from Riga to Istanbul - 3 hours</li>
<li>and from Istanbul to Singapore - 10 hours!</li>
</ul>
<p>I had 4 hours break at each airport because airports are so fun, right? I took a risk in Riga and went from airport to the city center, just to get fresh rain and a good coffee. I made it - thanks EU internet treat!</p>
<p>I decided to spend my 4 hours in Istanbul Airport since it was my first time flying more than 3 hours and I was scared that I fill fuck something up if I'd got to the city.</p>
<p>I felt like a responsible traveler:</p>
<ul>
<li>I found a gate 709,</li>
<li>sit in front of it, <strong>3 meters</strong> from the table where airport worker checks your passport and ticket</li>
<li>checked the depart time 2:00 in the morning,</li>
<li>checked the <strong>gate closing time 1:35</strong>,</li>
<li>picked up my laptop and start working.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was there <strong>3 hours ahead</strong>, what could go wrong? There were a couple of Chinese and Japanese guys around, so it was obviously clear this is the flight to the right location.</p>
<h2 id="going-too-deep"><a href="#going-too-deep">Going Too Deep</a></h2>
<p>So, I'm coding, preparing a <a href="https://github.com/rectorphp/demo">new Rector demo repository</a> for the conference and fixing few bugs I found along. It's around 1:00 and a guy comes to the table - &quot;it will start soon and I'm right here, great&quot;, I thought to myself. <strong>This man made me feel secure</strong>, I would have to be really stupid to miss <em>his</em> last call right in front of me.</p>
<p><strong>I got back to coding and dove deep to the flow</strong>, fixing the code and making test pass like a machine gun. It's around 1:25 when I rise my ahead again. Still no boarding, hm. It's probably delayed a bit, that happened on my last flight, no big deal, 10 minutes here and there.</p>
<p>I don't know how that happened but when I raise my head again from the code, it was <strong>1:35</strong>. What is going on? Why the guy didn't come to me to tell me to board? I looked around and I saw nobody else was boarding. There were still the same 20 people I saw when I came here. I swear this is the first time I realized, it's a bit weird that there are only 20 people flying to Singapore. I mean, how big the plane is?</p>
<p><strong>My heart started to racing, I must have fucked up something.</strong> I closed the computer and almost jumped to the desk:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Hi, is this the flight to Singapore?&quot;</li>
<li><em>&quot;Hello, I'm busy.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<p>I understood his not very clear English. <em>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!</em> Noise in my head, <strong>this is not the right gate</strong>. What will I tell Mike? That I was on airport 4 hours in advance and that I missed my 3rd flight? That's a great way to start an international speaker career, Tom!</p>
<p>I run to displays and checked for my flight... It's here, 709. Good, uff... wait, it's 705. <em>Damn!</em> These are moments I appreciate really good UX. There were no number signs, except mine 709, so <strong>I started running in random direction</strong>... numbers were going up. I U-turned, hoping for at least <em>some</em> logic.</p>
<p>Good, it's rising! But the gate was closing at 1:35 and it was 1:38. Oh no, <strong>not that London experience again, when we missed the flight to Prague</strong> (the night end-up being awesome because there were 8 of us).</p>
<p>I run like crazy! This is my only chance!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Well, I missed the flight and spend my &quot;awesome&quot; month in Istanbul...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>No, just kidding. <strong>I got almost heart attack, but in 10 seconds I found the right gate with 2 other last-call colleagues</strong>. I was thanking God, promising I'll never say anything bad to another living creature as thank-you reward for this gift.</p>
<p>Lesson learned? <strong>Ask, ask, ask!</strong> When I came to the group of people in 22:00, I could ask &quot;Is this flight to Singapore, right?&quot;. They'd say &quot;no&quot;, then I'd try to convince them it is, then I'd find the right gate. This one helped me a lot in next month, and it was just awesome!</p>

<p>I'm very glad I made it. People on the conference <strong>were possessed with kindness and generosity</strong> I never saw before on such a big IT event:</p>
<ul>
<li>from the best wing-woman &quot;Tom, have you met...&quot; that introduced me to many fellow-speakers and visitors,</li>
<li>over curious guys from all around Asia, who tried Rector and assumed every bug was their mistake,</li>
<li>to organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/coderkungfu">Michael Cheng</a>, who always let me rest from my first jet lag.</li>
</ul>
<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/phpasia/round.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"></div>
<p><strong>I'm very grateful I could be their guys, I enjoyed talking with you, sharing experience and views on life and code.</strong></p>
<p>I also loved panel discussion <em>PHP - The journey so far (and what's ahead)</em> with Rasmus Lerdorf, Sebastian Bergmann and Derick Rethans. The questions from the community were insightful and touching really important moments.</p>
<p>I would not believe how much can change in software in 15 years.</p>
<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/phpasia/coffee.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"></div>
<p>One more thing, <strong>the coffee was supreme</strong>. I never had better coffees at the conference - so good I had 6 of them in 2 hours.</p>
<h2 id="come-next-time"><a href="#come-next-time">Come Next Time!</a></h2>
<p>Michael shared with a big secret: <strong>not many people from Europe knew about the CFP</strong> or were willing to fly such a distance, who knows - there were actually more free talks slots.</p>
<p>This conference really loves to support diversity and international exchange visitors. So if you want to talk somewhere abroad and you've been to your neighbor country already, <strong>follow <a href="https://twitter.com/phpconfasia">@phpconfasia</a> and be ready to send your talks</strong>.</p>
<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/phpasia/mefie.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"></div>
<p>I'd be happy to go with you if I'll have the chance.</p>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/phpasia/nature.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"></div>
<p>I got a chance to stay a whole week (thanks again, Michael!) there and I must say, it's a huge crazy city.</p>
<p>But it also has...</p>
<ul>
<li>cheap places to eat in,</li>
<li><strong>super cheap public transport</strong> - where Berlin costs 7 €/day, you'll spend that in Singapore in 3 days</li>
<li><strong>rich free gardens</strong>,</li>
<li><strong>great coffee</strong> + wifi right in the center (too bad I found out the night before I left the city)</li>
<li>awesome views from the top of buildings,</li>
</ul>
<p>...and many more for you to discover</p>
<p>Everyone speaks English so it's easy to ask, orientate and get it right.</p>

</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>In the end, this conference gave me a lot to think about. There is more than Symfony, than Laravel, than PHP 7, than Europe.
There is huge PHP community I never knew about, with many awesome people... not people, <strong>but heroes who build their local communities, share their know-how and bring people together</strong> with much less payment and resource then we in Europe have.</p>
<p><strong>This gave me a kick from my bubble I live in</strong>. The kick I needed. Such a kick that during next 2 week I stayed in Malaysia it made me work on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://friendsofphp.org">Friendsofphp.org</a> - to grow from 200 PHP groups to 1023 PHP groups from the whole world</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/issues/638">Rector PHP Upgrades</a> - we all have framework preferences, but we all write code in some PHP version</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p>I had a great time - thank you Michael and the whole PHP Asia Conf team!</p>
<p>See you next time in Singapore.</p>
