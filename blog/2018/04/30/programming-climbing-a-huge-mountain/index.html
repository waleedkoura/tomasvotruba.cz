                        Let's take a break after 2 long code-posts from last week and enjoy bit of philosophy. I apply <em>the mountain climber</em> in programming for last 2 years and it really helps me to overcome difficult spots.
<br><br>
Today we'll climb together.
                    </div>
                </div>

                
                <p>Just a year ago I was deep-train traveling southern Europe and I worked on ApiGen (here <a href="/blog/2017/09/04/how-apigen-survived-its-own-death/">is a short story about that work</a>). I worked on a migration of the most coupled dependency, which was unmaintained for 3 years, to new one. You can imagine it like migration your application from Nette to Symfony or from Doctrine to Eloquent (or vice versa).</p>
<h2 id="rushing-up-is-rushing-to-fuck-up"><a href="#rushing-up-is-rushing-to-fuck-up">Rushing Up is Rushing to Fuck-Up</a></h2>
<p>First I approached this problem in very... how do they say it... agile way. Let's start committing and see what happens. I was sure I'll be over after a week. Well, I wasn't and I was angry at myself. The faster I tried to finish it the slower I went.</p>
<p>And this rush got me to a situation I had to revert the whole PR and start over again, after a week of work.</p>
<h2 id="know-your-path"><a href="#know-your-path">Know Your Path</a></h2>
<p>Then I stopped for a while and thought: Okay, I'm here under the mountain, there is the peak and want to get there. I don't see the peak or the way, I just know I want to climb this mountain.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/climb/climb-2.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>I had one package and I wanted to switch to the other. What are the minimal steps?</p>
<h2 id="make-safe-spots"><a href="#make-safe-spots">Make Safe Spots</a></h2>
<p>When you climb a mountain for the first time, you have rope, a buddy and clinch along the whole way.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/climb/climb-1.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<p><strong>These are all the safe spots and it's ok to use them.</strong> Well, unless you'd like to die climbing.</p>
<p>In programming I apply the same principles: I have tests, static analysis, coding standard fixers and CI. Without them, I'd be lost.</p>
<p>And are there no safe spots? <strong>I take a time before climbing and prepare these spots.</strong> I'll increase the code coverage for code part I'd like to work with - and that already gives me some hints, what the path looks like.</p>
<p>The same way you prepare for the climbing - you ask other climbers how it went, what are the hacks, where are the places to rest and where you should be careful.</p>
<h2 id="be-safe-like-a-pro"><a href="#be-safe-like-a-pro">Be Safe like a Pro</a></h2>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/climb/climb-3.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>As you can see, it's no shame to use the spots, <strike>even</strike> mainly professional climbers do that.</p>
<p><strong>Because the safer you feel, the better your brain operates and the faster you climb</strong> - either a mountain or a code you write.</p>
<h2 id="use-safe-spots"><a href="#use-safe-spots">Use Safe Spots</a></h2>
<p>If you already have such safe spots, be sure to use them. I've seen many applications that had over 30 tests but didn't actually use them - no continuous integration, no <a href="https://blog.martinhujer.cz/have-you-tried-composer-scripts/">simple scripts in composer</a> that could run them locally with <code>composer run-tests</code>.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/climb/climb-4.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>It doesn't matter that other programmer made it, that they don't cover 100 % of the code or that they use the other test framework I don't prefer. <strong>I'm grateful there is something that will help me to climb faster and that another climber made it for me, even though he didn't have to.</strong></p>
<h2 id="staying-in-the-present-moment-one-move-at-a-time"><a href="#staying-in-the-present-moment-one-move-at-a-time">Staying in the Present Moment - One Move at a Time</a></h2>
<p>Zen, Kaizen, Ikigai, Present moment, <a href="/blog/2017/09/25/3-non-it-books-that-help-you-to-become-better-programmer/#deep-work-by-cal-newport">Deep Work</a>, Flow. Whatever you call it, it matters.</p>
<p>When I program, I don't know what will happen in next 15 minutes. Maybe it will be over, or maybe I'll find a bug that I'll investigate for 2 hours in a row and then <a href="https://github.com/TomasVotruba/tomasvotruba.cz/commit/a890d5100e2226d4958504a50efa282fd1b2c4a1">use this workaround</a>.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/climb/climb-5.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>I don't see the end, only the next step. Same is for climbing, I don't see the top of the mountain. I barely see 5 meters ahead of me. But even if I see the top of the mountain it doesn't matter. I can only move my hands or legs just a few feet ahead of me.</p>

<p>One <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peace-Every-Step-Mindfulness-Everyday/dp/0553351397">Peace Step</a> at a Time  (great book, just reading it). One commit at a time. One merged pull-request at a time. Not 2, just 1.</p>
<h2 id="take-a-break"><a href="#take-a-break">Take a Break</a></h2>
<p>When you're tired, frustrated, angry or sad, will you rush to climb more and more steps? No, you'd take a break. Just hang on the rope for a while (not by the neck, it's not healthy!)... well, for <a href="https://lifehacker.com/52-minute-work-17-minute-break-is-the-ideal-productivi-1616541102">17 minutes</a> as I learned in one of the amazing <a href="https://www.danpink.com/pinkcast/">Pinkcasts</a>.</p>
<p>It might be a coffee, it might be a transfer to another train, it might be toilet visit.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/climb/climb-6.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>You probably won't believe it, but most breakthroughs come to me in the toilet room (intellectual, not physical damaging any part of the toilet).</p>
<p>Why? Because when the brain enters <em>the serendipity-mode</em>, it starts to think subconsciously and connect thoughts more effectively than with active thinking. For example, a few paragraphs up I made a workaround because key in the array didn't match the <code>PostFile</code> <code>id</code> in one spot. It worked in 3 other places in the application, but 1 just missed it. Then in my <em>toilet time</em>, it came to me that this can be solved by using a collection. One iterable immutable object everywhere.</p>
<p>Well, now it's like standing on the top of the hill and seeing the elevator that was on the left side all along. But when I was under the mountain, I didn't see it. I needed to take a break to see.</p>
<h2 id="the-mountain-climber-way"><a href="#the-mountain-climber-way">The Mountain Climber Way</a></h2>
<p>So this is my climbing approach to code (I'm not a climber, to be clear).</p>
<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/climb/climb-7.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">
<p>The more you climb, the better you know the terrain and the more you can improvise. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/features/athletes/alex-honnold/most-dangerous-free-solo-climb-yosemite-national-park-el-capitan/">Like this guy, who climbed a 3000-feet tall mountain in 4 hours</a>. <strong>Without a rope.</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>And how do you approach your coding?</strong></p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>Happy climbing!</p>
